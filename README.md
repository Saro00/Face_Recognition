# Face_Recognition
Test a CNN pre-trained model for face recognition.
Because of GitHub's memory conditions I was not able to upload pre-trained models.
You need to download 3 caffemodel files by your own.
You need: 
1. age_net.caffemodel for age classification (https://github.com/GilLevi/AgeGenderDeepLearning/blob/master/models/age_net.caffemodel)
2. gender_net.caffemodel for gender classification (https://github.com/GilLevi/AgeGenderDeepLearning/blob/master/models/gender_net.caffemodel)
3. EmotiW_VGG_S.caffemodel for emotion classification (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BydFau0VP3XSNVYtWnNPMU1TOGM/view)
